# Experiments in Neural Networks and Deep Learning

<hr>

A grab bag of code. It's probably not useful to you, but it's up here so I can use it remotely on AWS EC2.

See [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen for some of this code, which I've rewritten for Python 3.

The diabetic retinopathy detection work uses data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data).

Take a look at the Retina notebook for samples.
